### 🚀 Bridging the Gap: From Network Infrastructure to Global Payments & Fraud Logic

I am a veteran **Sales Engineer** with a deep background in **ISP Infrastructure (Layer 2/3)** now specializing in the **Payments, Fraud, and Compliance** sector. 

In my previous life, I mastered the "pipes" of the internet. Now, I’m mastering the value that flows through them. I bring a unique perspective to fintech: I don't just see a `payment_intent` API call; I understand the network handshake and the millisecond-latency requirements that separate a "Succeeded" transaction from a "Timed Out" loss of revenue.

## 📈 Why Hire an ISP-Fluent SE?
Most payment experts stop at the API layer. I go deeper:
1. **Network Reliability:** I understand the routing logic that ensures high-availability for mission-critical gateways.
2. **Security Foundations:** My networking background means I treat tokenization with "Zero Trust" principles.
3. **Strategic Discovery:** I don't just demo features; I solve business friction and reduce compliance overhead.
