### 🚀 Bridging the Gap: From Network Infrastructure to Global Payments & Fraud Logic

I am a veteran **Sales Engineer** with a deep background in **ISP Infrastructure (Layer 2/3)** now specializing in the **Payments, Fraud, and AML (Anti-Money Laundering)** sector. 

In my previous life, I mastered the "pipes" of the internet. Now, I’m mastering the value that flows through them. I bring a unique perspective to fintech: I don't just see a `payment_intent` API call; I understand the network handshake, the data hygiene, and the millisecond-latency requirements that separate a "Succeeded" transaction from a "Timed Out" loss of revenue.

## 📈 Why Hire an ISP-Fluent SE?
Most payment experts stop at the API layer. I go deeper:
1.  **Network Reliability:** I understand the routing logic that ensures high-availability for mission-critical payment gateways.
2.  **Security Foundations:** My Layer 2/3 background means I treat data encryption and tokenization with "Zero Trust" infrastructure principles.
3.  **The "Chief Reminding Officer":** As an SE, I lead with Discovery. I don't just demo features; I solve business friction.
