# 👋🏾 Hi, I’m Lewis Stargill

I’m a technically driven professional with a strong focus on system integration, data accuracy, and secure process automation. My background combines business and technical problem-solving — helping bridge the gap between engineering, sales, and client needs.  

I build and understand the tools that power modern financial ecosystems — from API integrations and secure authentication systems to automation that improves the customer and operational experience.

### ⚙️ Technical Philosophy

I believe that great technical professionals are translators — helping connect business goals, engineering solutions, and client needs.  

I approach every project with three principles:
- **Clarity:** Solutions should be easy to understand, use, and maintain  
- **Security:** Every workflow should protect data and user trust  
- **Scalability:** Build once, scale efficiently

### 📈 Career Goals

My career goal is to work in the **FinTech industry** — specifically in **payment processing, fraud prevention, or risk management** — where I can support both internal teams and external clients in solving complex technical challenges.  

I’m especially interested in roles as a **Solutions Engineer, Sales Engineer, or Technical Integration Specialist** with organizations like **Visa (including CyberSource), Mastercard, PayPal, or Stripe.**

I want to continue developing my ability to explain and implement complex systems like **APIs, SSO authentication, and data integrations** in ways that create practical, secure solutions for both clients and teams.

My background in **networking (Layer 2 and Layer 3)** provides a strong understanding of how systems communicate securely, which helps me approach integrations from both a business and infrastructure perspective.
