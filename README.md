### 🧩 Featured Projects

#### 1. **Salesforce Lookup Tool (Python Desktop Application)**
A secure desktop tool developed to connect with Salesforce via OneLogin SSO using OAuth2 authentication.  
It allows users to log in through their company’s identity provider, query Salesforce objects, and export results in a clean and efficient GUI built with `CustomTkinter`.

- **Key Features:**
  - OAuth2 + OneLogin SSO authentication
  - Modular query system for multiple Salesforce objects
  - Secure session management with real-time user validation
  - Export options (CSV and Excel)
  - Clean, user-friendly interface with dynamic theme handling

- **Technical Skills Demonstrated:**
  Python GUI development, API integration, OAuth2 flow, user authentication logic, dynamic interface design.

#### 2. **Payments Fraud API Lab**
A project designed to simulate API-driven fraud detection and data validation workflows.  
This project showcases how API endpoints can be used to test transactions, detect anomalies, and apply business logic for fraud prevention.

- **Key Features:**
  - RESTful API design and endpoint testing
  - Data parsing and validation
  - JSON handling and response management
  - Secure and modular code organization

- **Technical Skills Demonstrated:**
  API architecture, request/response handling, JSON parsing, exception management, data integrity verification.

### ⚙️ Development Philosophy

I believe that good code should be:
- **Readable** — clear logic, meaningful variable names, and modular design  
- **Reliable** — secure, well-tested, and built for real-world use  
- **Maintainable** — structured to scale and evolve over time  

My approach is to blend technical precision with usability, ensuring that both the end user and the support teams benefit from the solutions I build.

### 📈 Current Goals

- Continue expanding into data engineering and systems integration  
- Strengthen advanced Python and API design principles  
- Explore full-stack development and cloud integration (AWS, Azure)
