# 👋🏾 Hi, I’m Lewis Stargill

I’m a technically driven professional with a strong focus on data-driven applications, secure system integration, and process automation. My experience includes building Python-based tools that connect business systems with APIs, improving operational efficiency and data integrity through automation, and designing interfaces that simplify technical workflows.

### 💻 Technical Focus

- **Languages:** Python (Core, OOP, GUI, and API Integration), SQL, JavaScript (basic)
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Flask, CustomTkinter, Pandas, Requests, Git, PowerShell
- **Concepts:** OAuth2 Authentication, RESTful API Design, Data Querying and Export (CSV, Excel), GUI Development
- **Platforms:** Salesforce, OneLogin SSO, Microsoft 365, Network Systems (Layer 2 & Layer 3)

### 🧩 Featured Projects

#### 1. **Salesforce Lookup Tool (Python Desktop Application)**
A secure desktop tool developed to connect with Salesforce via OneLogin SSO using OAuth2 authentication.  
It allows users to log in through their company’s identity provider, query Salesforce objects, and export results in a clean and efficient GUI built with `CustomTkinter`.

- **Key Features:**
  - OAuth2 + OneLogin SSO authentication
  - Modular query system for multiple Salesforce objects
  - Secure session management with real-time user validation
  - Export options (CSV and Excel)
  - Clean, user-friendly interface with dynamic theme handling

- **Technical Skills Demonstrated:**
  Python GUI development, API integration, OAuth2 flow, user authentication logic, and dynamic interface design.

- **Repository:** [salesforce-lookup-tool](https://github.com/Stlewis15/salesforce-lookup-tool)

#### 2. **Payments Fraud API Lab**
A project designed to simulate API-driven fraud detection and data validation workflows.  
This project demonstrates how Python can be used to design, test, and validate financial transactions using logic and thresholds similar to real-world payment fraud detection systems.

- **Key Features:**
  - RESTful API design and endpoint testing
  - Data parsing, validation, and anomaly detection
  - JSON handling and structured response logic
  - Secure and modular architecture

- **Technical Skills Demonstrated:**
  API architecture, data verification, transaction flow modeling, fraud detection logic, and exception handling.

- **Repository:** [payments-fraud-api](https://github.com/Stlewis15/payments-fraud-api)

### ⚙️ Development Philosophy

I believe that good code should be:
- **Readable** — clear logic, meaningful variable names, and modular design  
- **Reliable** — secure, well-tested, and built for real-world use  
- **Maintainable** — structured to scale and evolve over time  

I focus on blending technical precision with usability, ensuring that solutions serve both the end users and the teams who maintain them.

### 📈 Career Goals

My career goal is to work in the **payment processing and financial fraud prevention** space — building tools that improve security, data accuracy, and risk mitigation across digital transactions.  
I’m particularly interested in joining innovative organizations like **Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, or Stripe**, where I can contribute to fraud analytics, API development, and secure data integrations.

I also have a growing interest in **anti-money laundering (AML)** technologies and compliance systems.  
My foundation in **networking (Layer 2 and Layer 3)** gives me an additional perspective on how data moves securely through distributed environments — an advantage when designing reliable financial systems.
